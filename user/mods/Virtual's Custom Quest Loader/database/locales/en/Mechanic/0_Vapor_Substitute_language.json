  "68d16a141400b4bfc99edce6 description": "I am trying to keep ash away from the workbench. Sparks and nicotine make a bad mix when you are leaning over solvents and open boards. A vape will do the job for now. Interchange has the right kind of shelves for this sort of plastic. Techlight, the kiosks around it, even the pharmacy lanes sometimes get stock when nobody is watching. Bring me one and we will both live a little longer.",
