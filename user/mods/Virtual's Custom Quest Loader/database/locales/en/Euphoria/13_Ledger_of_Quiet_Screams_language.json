  "68cd8d43623ef40b2d1c273f description": "Terragroup rides its secrets up and down like sermons. I want that lift mapped to our rhythm. Tag the elevator so I can listen to cables and cameras later, then thin nearby scavs so the block stops advertising. We are buying predictability, not headlines.",
  "68cd8d43623ef40b2d1c273f startedMessageText": "Mark the Terragroup lift with a GPS Beacon.\nCut local noise until the halls feel expensive and bored.",
  "68cd8d43623ef40b2d1c273f successMessageText": "The lift wears our mark and the block went quiet.\nThat is the confession I wanted.",
