  "68ceb12add024b9709fe9119 description": "After lights-out the mall grows teeth and honest mistakes. I need lanes that hold under neon and nerves. Work Interchange at night, pick fights you meant to pick, and leave before the signs remember your shape. This tells me your kit runs when the aisles bite back and whether I can move clients through that dark without buying noise.",
  "68ceb12add024b9709fe9119 startedMessageText": "Enter when the signs dim.\nChoose indoor quarrels and end them on purpose.\nKeep the exit clean.",
  "68ceb12add024b9709fe9119 successMessageText": "Night kept your secret and the aisles forgot your face.\nGood. I can schedule work in there.",
