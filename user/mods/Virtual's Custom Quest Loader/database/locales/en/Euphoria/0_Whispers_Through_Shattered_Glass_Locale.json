Only then, she says, will the Tablet stop stuttering and speak plainly.\nOnce you're done marking the areas on the Tablet make sure to bring it back to me.\nIf you come back breathing, she'll talk to you like a friend, if not, she'll listen for you in the static, and don't forget to pick up the Weeb Tablet before marking the locations, she left it on a butcher table next to the Terragroup locked door.",
