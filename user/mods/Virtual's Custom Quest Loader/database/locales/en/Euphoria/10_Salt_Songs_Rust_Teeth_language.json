  "68cca4d3f2e4b96038567be0 description": "I am testing shoreline lanes for small runs and quiet exits. Scav bands along the coast hear footsteps and sell panic; I want them unsure.\nWork the shoreline on your terms, cut the noise-makers, and do it in one raid so my map reads true. Skip the resort drama.\nWhen it is finally quiet, we can start moving real cargo through the salt.",
