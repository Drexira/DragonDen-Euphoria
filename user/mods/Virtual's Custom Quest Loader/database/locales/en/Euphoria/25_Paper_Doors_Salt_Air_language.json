Read the beaches, the upper study, and the village without starting a story. Do it in one go so my map is truthful when I move crates along the water.",
  "68cecb1d1f236c62e1c0ea85 startedMessageText": "Pretty houses, ugly bones.\nWalk the polite places and memorize the air in your lungs.",
  "68cecb1d1f236c62e1c0ea85 successMessageText": "Your breathing learned the route and the route learned nothing about you.\nThat is how we travel.",
  "68cecb1d1f236c62e1c0ea85 acceptPlayerMessage": "Cross the sand, climb the quiet room, pass through the village.\nMove like you belong and leave like you were never there.",
