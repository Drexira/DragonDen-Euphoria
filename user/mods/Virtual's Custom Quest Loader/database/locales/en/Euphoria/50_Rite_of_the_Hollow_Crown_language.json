  "68d5f28b5251fe6725ab97f2 description": "Four raids in one breath.\nNo Armor, No Excuses, buck up because this will be a long one.\nCustoms: use a GPS Beacon on the 3-story Dorms locked entrance, then pull the taped dynamite from Big Red admin office and keep your hands steady.\nInterchange: tuck the dynamite into the Power Station transformers and prove you can choose your fights without turning glass into gossip.\nReserve below: there is a C4 block cached inside Black Bishop Workshop. Lift it and keep your route boring.\nLabs in white light: the Detonator Electrical waits in the Weapon Testing Area. Wire it, then seat the C4 in the Test Room and pick your PMCs.\nEach piece is found and placed inside its own raid. Extract alive after every step. Die once and the crown shatters.",
