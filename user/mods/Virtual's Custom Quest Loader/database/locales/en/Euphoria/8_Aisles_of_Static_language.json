  "68cc7f4d7e7490d1192db2f3 description": "I am charting where Interchange hums and where it stutters. Those dips tell me when shutters stall, when cameras blink, and when to move crates without buying attention.\nWalk the bright rows and the outside yards, feel the current with your feet, and note the choke points by being there.\nNo markers yet, just a clean pass and a clean exit. This is preparation for switches I will ask you to flip later.",
