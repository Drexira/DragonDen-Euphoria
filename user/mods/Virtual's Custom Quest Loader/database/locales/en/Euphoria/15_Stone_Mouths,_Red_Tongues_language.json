  "68cd9cc8ab9a667de34d24a1 description": "Reserve's lower halls decide who leaves. I want the bunker to speak our syllables when we visit.\nLift a clean bite of C4 from near the power rooms and set it by the D2 service path. This is a pressure test: watchers, cameras, and nerves. Plant, hush, exit. If the air tastes like copper, you stayed too long.",
  "68cd9cc8ab9a667de34d24a1 startedMessageText": "Give the bunker a tongue and teach it to whisper.\nLay the weight, keep the room boring, leave before questions start.",

  "68cd9cc8ab9a667de34d24a1 acceptPlayerMessage": "Find a proper bite below near the power feeds.\nPlant it by the D2 extract corridor and drift out.",
