A tall red can under the mall lets me pull power or pull attention when I choose.\nLift the can from OLI without teaching the aisles your name, then set it by the Goshan ramp where the wiring hums.\nThis proves you can move weight through bright spaces and tuck it where janitors will argue but not find.",
