Tag each antenna with GPS Beacons so I can track sweeps and dead zones.\nWhile you are there, bring me a pinch of Gunpowder Eagle. It primes my tests and tells me your pockets can carry heat without leaking.\nLeave the weather station boring and intact; we are stealing the sky's gossip, not starting a story.",
