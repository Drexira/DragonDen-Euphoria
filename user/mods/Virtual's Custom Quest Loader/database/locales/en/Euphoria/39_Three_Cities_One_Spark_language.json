  "68d353aa57fef7eb0c29af16 description": "Split the lesson across boards. Reserve gives me a clever hand, Streets gives me a heavy breath, and Factory learns to remember both.\nLast intel: the electrical detonator sits in White King upstairs on a desk. The C4 block is behind the Diner in the alley with the purple fish.\nPlant the switch on the Factory pumping station table and tuck the block under the medical tent corner in the basement. Clean lifts, neat placements, clean exit.\nWe are measuring response to whisper and shout so I can route crates without paying panic tax.",
